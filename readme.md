### Code Style Guide
- All code must be commented!!!
- Only lowercase file and directory names, limit to single words
    - Keep it simple stupid
- Variable and function names are in camelCase
- Class names start with a capital letter, but the remainder is CamelCase
- Quotes for strings, etc, are double quotes eg. " and not ' as Python is closer to C/C++ and " is used to denote string literals
