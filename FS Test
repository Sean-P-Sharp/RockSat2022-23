HOW TO USE
1. Write fs = FileStructure() at top of file

To create folders -- fs.create_folders()
    -Example: fs.create_folders()
    - Will create all folders specified within the __init__
    
To create a file -- fs.write_to_folder("[folder name]", "[subfolder name {write "" if none}]", "[initialization statement]")
    - Example: fs.write_to_folder("BME680", "Temperature", "Temperature file created on {time}")
    - Will create a csv file in designated folder
    
To write to a already created file -- fs.write_to_file("[folder name]", "[subfolder name {write "" if none}]", "[data]")
    - Example: fs.write_to_folder("BME680", "Temperature", "123.45")
    - Will write to the most recently created file in a specific folder and subfolder
    
To use Flight Log - 
    1. Create flight log file at top of file - fs.write_to_folder("Flight_Log", "", "Folders initialized")
